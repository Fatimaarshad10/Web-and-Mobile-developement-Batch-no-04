By the end of this class, you will be able to:
- Install and configure Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Navigate the VS Code interface
- Install essential extensions like Live Server
- Create a proper project folder structure
- Write and run your first HTML file

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Internet connection for downloads
- Basic computer skills

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Installing Visual Studio Code

1. Go to the official VS Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download the version appropriate for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the installation prompts
4. Launch VS Code after installation

### 2. Understanding the VS Code Interface

Once VS Code is open, familiarize yourself with these key areas:
- **Activity Bar**: Left sidebar with icons for Explorer, Search, Source Control, etc.
- **Side Bar**: Shows file explorer, search results, etc.
- **Editor**: Main area where you write code
- **Terminal**: Bottom panel for running commands
- **Status Bar**: Bottom bar showing current file, line number, etc.

### 3. Installing the Live Server Extension

1. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
2. Search for "Live Server"
3. Click "Install" on the extension by Ritwick Dey
4. Restart VS Code if prompted

### 4. Creating Your Project Structure

1. Create a new folder for your web development projects (e.g., `WebDevProjects`)
2. Inside that folder, create a subfolder for this class (e.g., `class01`)
3. Open the `class01` folder in VS Code:
   - File → Open Folder
   - Select your `class01` folder

### 5. Writing Your First HTML File

1. Create a new file: File → New File (or `Ctrl+N` / `Cmd+N`)
2. Save it as `index.html`: File → Save As → `index.html`
3. Copy the following basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello World! Welcome to Web Development!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

4. Save the file (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`)

### 6. Running Your HTML File

1. Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer
2. Select "Open with Live Server"
3. Your webpage will open in your default browser
4. Any changes you make will automatically refresh in the browser!

## 📁 File Structure

After completing the setup, your project should look like this:

```
WebDevProjects/
└── class01/
    └── index.html
```
